# 🧍 BMI Calculator

A simple Python program to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input for weight and height.  
The program also classifies the BMI into categories (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese) and saves the results to a file.

## 🚀 Features
- Takes weight (kg) and height (cm) as input.
- Calculates BMI using the formula:  
  BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) ** 2)
- Rounds the result to 1 decimal place.
- Categorizes BMI:
  - Underweight: BMI < 18.5
  - Normal weight: 18.5 ≤ BMI < 25
  - Overweight: 25 ≤ BMI < 30
  - Obese: BMI ≥ 30
- Saves the results to `bmi_results.txt`.

## 📁 Files
- `bmi_calculator.py` — Main Python file
- `bmi_results.txt` — Example saved results
